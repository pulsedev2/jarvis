# Jarvis

Jarvis is a vocal assistant which aim to be fully modular.

## Modules

Modules will be totally custom and easy to make. 
Thanks to an own language / file "**.module**" they will be seamless to add an easy to make.

Actually (_v1.0_) native modules are:
- Hello
- Weather
- Error
- Thanks
- Hour

Push request for some new module are welcome.

## Libraries

We made actual libraries in Java but Jarvis project aim to make them easy like modules to make and add.

Libraries :
- WIP Time
- WIP Random

## STT

Jarvis uses Google STT API but due to cost and latency we plan to use deepspeech from mozilla.

## TTS

Jarvis uses IBM TTS API.

## Future plan

We plan to add some facial detection, and some module print in 3D with electronic. In example, we plan to make a module with a camera, a microphone and a speaker in order to expend the range of jarvis.

## Socket Communication

Jarvis use socket communication to talk with his UI. Port: 2008
